# Tomato Plant Disease Detection using CNN

## Introduction

Tomato Plant Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a project aimed at automatically identifying diseases in tomato plants from images. The CNN model analyzes the images and classifies them into different disease categories or labels them as healthy.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies (Python, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.).

3. Link to dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf

4. Preprocess the dataset, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance using the provided scripts.

5. Once the model is trained, use it to predict diseases in new images or integrate it into an agricultural system for real-time disease detection.
